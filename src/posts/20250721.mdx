## Smarter Commits for Everyone

Collaborating with others on code is way more complex than working alone.  
What really made a difference for me was learning, often the hard way, how small, focused commits can completely change a team’s workflow.  
Today, I want to share the mistakes I made while first learning how to collaborate—the kinds of things nobody really teaches you.

<br />

## 🛠️ 1. Don’t Just Commit—Split by Purpose

In the beginning, I’d just keep coding and commit whenever I felt like it.  
That led to things like mixing “profile photo upload” and “fixed error message display” in a single commit.  
Rolling back changes or reviewing code became a real mess.

- **One job/bugfix/refactor = one commit**
- If I change multiple files, I always break it down by the feature or fix
- If my commit message is getting long, that’s a sign to split it up!

<br />

| All at once (not great)        | Split by feature (much better) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| feat: image upload & error fix | feat: profile image upload     |
|                                | fix: error message display bug |

<br />

#### Why This Works

- **Easy rollbacks & bug tracking**: If something goes wrong, just roll back that one commit.
- **Clearer code reviews**: Reviewers see exactly what changed—less confusion, less miscommunication.
- **Cleaner history**: When I look back at my logs, it’s obvious what was done and why.

<br />
<br />

## 📝 2. Ditch “fix”—Write Clear Commit Messages

![book img](/posts/20250721/postit.png)
commit message was just `"fix"` or `"update"`, even I’d be confused about what I did a few days later.  
Now, I always summarize _what_ I changed and _why_ in a single, clear line.

<br />

```text
# Don’t do this
git commit -m "fix"

# Do this instead
git commit -m "fix: prevent wrong alert showing during cancellation (#42)"
```

<br />

- **Be specific**: One line that explains _what_ and _why_.
- **Keep it under 76 characters** so it’s easy to read in `git log`.
- **Add an issue number** or a quick note for context—this makes life easier for everyone.

<br />
<br />
## 🔄 3. After Committing, Open Small PRs with Context

(PRs) don’t have to be huge batches of changes.  
I like to open small PRs for each feature or fix, and always explain _what_, _why_, and _how_ I changed something.

<br />

| Not-so-great PR Example  | Clear PR Example                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title:** Profile edits | **Title:** [Booking] Add error handling for cancel API                             |
| **Body:** (empty)        | **Body:**- Handle 409 error during cancel- Improve user experience- Related to #42 |

<br />

Doing it this way means everyone knows what’s changed—reviewers can give quick, meaningful feedback, and nobody gets lost in the details.

<br />
## 🤏 If Your Message Is Getting Long, That’s a Split Signal!

If I can’t explain a commit or PR in one simple sentence, it’s usually a sign I’m doing too much at once.  
When that happens, I take a step back and break things down into smaller, single-purpose pieces.  
Short, clear messaging and focused PRs build trust and make teamwork much smoother.

<br />
## ✨ Wrap-Up: A Good Commit Makes Everyone’s Life Easier
<br />
- **Small, focused commits** - **Clear commit messages** - **Brief, descriptive PRs**
<br />
These three habits might seem like a small thing, but they really do make a difference—for
me, for my teammates, and for the whole project.

Next time you commit, ask yourself: _Is this truly helpful for me and my team?_

<br />
**It’s never too late to start making smarter commits. 🚀**

## My App Development Growth Journey

While working as a web developer, I got involved in developing an Expo app, which sparked a deeper interest in frontend app development.
Previously, my focus had been on implementing features and refactoring code,
but over time, I found myself wanting to experience the full cycle—from planning to launch, the entire A to Z of app development.

That’s how I began developing my **first small but meaningful MVP app.**

> Your product doesn’t have to be completely new.
> It just needs to help users get their tasks done.
> Rather than offering 100 half-baked features and delaying your launch,
> a smaller number of well-polished features will provide a much better user experience.

## Creating a Service to Solve My Own Problem

The goal of this app was to **solve a problem I personally faced**. The idea came from one of my hobbies: baking. When baking at home, I only had a tall round pan (size 1), but most recipes I wanted to follow used a shorter round pan (size 2). Every time, I had to manually recalculate all the ingredient ratios, which was a hassle. So I decided to develop a **baking-specific calculator app**—a simple tool that did nothing but calculate.

<br />

I didn’t need the full CRUD set; since it was a **one-time-use calculator**,
I left out Read, Update, and Delete.

<br />
After completing and launching the app, I started to wonder: “What’s next?”

I didn’t want to stop at just solving my own inconvenience,
so I posted in a baking community I frequented to see if others had the same problem.

The response was much warmer than I expected. Meeting users’ needs led my post to become the most popular of the week,
with over 200 likes and nearly 100 comments—an **unexpected but rewarding experience**.

<br />
However, since it was a one-time-use calculator, I received a lot of feedback about
the lack of features for saving, editing, or deleting results. Feature requests poured
in from the very beginning, so I prioritized them and updated the app step by step.
<br />
Even though the update frequency has slowed, I’m still seeing a steady increase in
new users, which is encouraging.

<br />

I realized that properly responding to user feedback is a powerful driver for
service growth.

## What Image Should My Service Have?

Initially, I focused only on the “cuteness” of my app’s UI. I thought users would be satisfied, but that expectation was only half right. Despite having certain features, I kept receiving VOCs (Voice of Customer) like, “Can you add this feature?” or “Does this feature exist?”—especially from older users, not the younger generation.

That’s when I realized I had completely overlooked one of my main user groups: people in their 50s and 60s.

<br />
Through this experience, I solidified my UX goal as **“easy and intuitive.”** Home
baking tends to attract more women than men, and users range from young people to
older generations. I learned that focusing only on pretty UI has its limits. The
most important UX point is to **reduce the time users spend struggling with the app**.
<br />
Since then, I’ve been consciously developing with this direction in mind. I plan
to add accessibility improvements in the next update so users of all ages can use
the app more comfortably.

<br />I want to always remember that the true image my service should have is
<br /> **a tool anyone can easily use.**

## Are You Living the Life of a Creator?

There’s a passage from a book that resonates with me:

<br />

> “In the profession of a novelist, there is no winning or losing. What matters
> most is whether the work you wrote meets the standards you set for yourself.
> For creators, motivation quietly and surely exists within oneself, and there is no
> need to seek any form or standard externally.”

<br />

I believe this applies to all creators. We all live as **silent creators**. Winning or losing doesn’t matter. Rather than blindly pursuing “perfection,” I want to **keep building and move toward sustainability**.
